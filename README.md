Hi mom
# Introduction

This package contains a list of short exercises that I think are helpful
to master if you wish to improve your C or C++ skills. Some of them are
classic problems, and some of them are my own horrible inventions.

Each exercise (found in 'problems.hpp' and 'problems.cpp') is a single
function, and most implementations require only a few lines of code. For
each exercise, I have provided a block comment describing: inputs, outputs,
restrictions, and a hint.

The solutions are meant to be very simple, the tricky part is figuring out
how to implement them in C or C++. My hints will lead you in the right
direction in terms of research.

You should have done some tutorials in C or C++ before attempting these. The
problems are not a substitute for proper tutorials, they are just challenges.

# Rules

You cannot (or should not need to) create any classes, structs, helper functions,
or global scope variables. Each solution should be self contained in the
function definition. I will let you know if there is a specific standard
library class or function you should use.

You may use previous functions you've written only if they appear above
the current function.

# Files

### main.cpp:

This source file contains the main entry point to the program, 'main'.
You shouldn't need to go here unless you find a bug. It just runs some
test code I've written to test your functions and produce output.

### testing.hpp/.cpp:

This is my testing code. It just tests your functions and produces
output. I probably didn't try every edge case, so make sure you test
your code for yourself too.

### problems.hpp:

This header file contains the declarations for all of your functions,
and the comments describing the problems. You don't have to change
anything in here, just read it.

### problems.cpp:

This is where you implement your solutions.

# How to Build

1. Make sure you're on a Linux machine with 'g++' installed, or a Mac with
   XCode and the command line dev tools installed.

2. Open a terminal and navigate to this directory.

3. Run the command 'make'.

If you want to clean up your compiled code and delete your executable,
just run 'make clean'. This will not touch any of your source code, just
the compiled stuff.

# Using the Program

The program 'cprobs' takes <= 1 argument. With 0 args, it will just run
all test cases until it either crashes from one of your bugs, or gets to the
end. With 1 arg where the argument is the name of a specific function,
it will run only that test case.

Example: './cprobs countBits' will run only the test case for the
    'countBits' function.
